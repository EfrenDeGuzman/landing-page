This is my second project for Odin. It will be focused on the front-end (HTML, CSS) and I will be applying all that I've learned. Most of which is the flexbox properties and properly laying out a nice looking page.

I made the theme of my project after the game "Hades" by Supergiant Games (https://www.supergiantgames.com/), all the images used belong to them.
